I'm a post-doctoral researcher in the <a href="http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/">Haxby Lab</a>. My work focuses on understanding and modeling the interactions between mental health, functional brain connectivity and smartphone usage. Before Dartmouth I worked in the <a href="https://king.med.harvard.edu/">King Lab</a> at Harvard Medical School developing novel methods analyze high-throughput imaging and screening data. I received my BA in <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/neuroscience/">Neuroscience</a> from Bowdoin College.

When I'm not teaching or doing research I can often be found running or skiing. I also coach youth skiing through <a href="https://stowenordic.org/youth-winter-ski-program-2020-21/">Stowe Nordic's Bill Koch League (BKL)</a> program.
