RNA interference (RNAi) is a useful tool to target and inhibit translation by degrading mRNA molecules. High-throughput screening with thousands of RNAi molecules is now possible with automated microscopes and advanced image analysis pipelines, but false positives complicate analysis of these screens. This approach identifies candidate off-target effects of RNAi, which can enhance the validation rate in RNAi screens .
